The files in this directory run a monte carlo simulation of laser fluence in
either a flat surfaced bit of tissue or as a interstitial laser.
Various laser types are implemented via different function pointers.
see multi_run.m for available function pointers

The needed input to this function is the number of photons to be run,
the beam profile type, and the radius of the beam.
It is programmed to output the number of photons reflected, absorbed, and 
transmitted, as well as three r-z grids representing the number of photons
absorbed in grid section, the fluence of the grid section, and the heating  
in the grid section.  mu_a, mu_s, g, and the power, are passed to the
matlab function scatter_simulation. The index of reflection and
the depth of tissue needs to be specified.
For more description see scatter_simulation_*.m

The file ascii_write.m is meant to take the output grid and write it
into the appropriate ascii format for the dddas code also outputs an
avs field file. type:

avs -cli "script -play field_vis.cli"

to open avs network


multi_run.m is a file meant to allow the user to run the code multiple
 times with multiple values of mu_a mu_s and g.
